# Automacorp Backend - Erwin MARTIN & CÃ©line NI

This Git repository contains the Automacorp Backend developped for a programming course.
The goal was to implement the backend of an application managing buildings, rooms, windows, heaters and temperature sensors.
All of this can, for example, serve as a simulation to understand how to efficiently use energy during winters.
